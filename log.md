# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Followed 

**Thoughts:** The hardest part is getting started. Built a Library in .NET CORE 2.2
Built a unit testing project for the libary using xUnit testing tool.
Two Types of Tests: 
[Theory] 
Theory allows you to pass a data source into your unit testing function. Each line of the data source runs through the function, so the function runs for as many lines of data you pass. 
Def: Theories are test which are only true for a particular set of data. 
[Fact]
Fact allows you to assert the return value of functions. Basic assertions are Assert.True
Assert.IsEqual, Assert.IsNotEqual
Def:Facts are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions. Invariant:  a condition that can be relied upon to be true during the execution of a program. "Never changing"
**Resources:** WordCounter Library, Console App, Unit Tests per [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/using-on-mac-vs-full-solution)
