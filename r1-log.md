## Log
### R1D2
Started day 2 with installing libman from dotnet tools
fixed issue with libman link not working in Mac terminal. 
Created SignalR sample app using tutorial. 

Noticed Javascript editor lag in VS2019. Potentially due to Intellisense for ES6? but not finding a way to turn it off. 

### R1D1 
Started day 1 with the MSDOCs WordCounter Library . Using Visual Studio 2019
